        <h1>Redefining the Solution for the VR Experience</h1>
        <p>During my time working at the Virtual Construction Lab at Schuco (VCL) as a UI/UX Designer, I noticed that
            UX design for Virtual Reality(VR) lacks a clear workflow unlike other applications for the web, mobile
            devices, and desktop among others.</p>
        <p>This article will discuss the problems I encountered when I did research and design for VR and
            share solutions that makes the VR experience more intuitive and easy to understand.

        <h2>2 Key Problems Associated with the VR Experience</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-12">
                <p>The VR team conducted a usability testing and they discovered that most people had difficulty
                    navigating the VR space for two key reasons: </p>
                <p>• Open Space Environment </p>
                <p>• VR Controllers</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>The Open Space Concern</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p>Many users grew perplexed as a result of the open space environment. To clarify this, the “Residential
                Project” made by VCL is considered where the game begins at the front door. As a matter of fact, the
                team was concerned about showcasing Schuco’s unique product – the ADS75 door; hence this specific start
                point.</p>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/gSyJL6g/Image1.png" width="50%" height="auto" class="mb-4">
            <p>The image above presents a demonstration of the multiple directions in the space which a user can take.
                However, this open space leaves the user uncertain about where to go or the first action to perform.
                This problem is further complicated when a user moves using teleportation.</p>
            <p>In the real world, teleportation varies from how human beings move in the 3D space which makes up the VR
                experience. While some users prefer to identify it as “zoom in,” teleportation in this space is similar
                to an abrupt space switching. As a result, the constant space switching and the open space problem
                leave a user feeling indecisive.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Possible Solutions to the VR Open Space Problem</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p>The VR open space environment problem can be fixed by:</p>
            <p>1. Putting a mini-map in the viewpoint</p>
            <p>2. Narrowing down the space using a smart level design</p><br>
            <h3>Putting a Mini-map in the Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>
                The mini-map is designed to display every path and location of Schuco products in the VR space. This
                solution might equally help users to boost their teleportation skill as it enables them to see their
                new location when they leave a specific point. Additionally, offering a mini-map amounts to improving
                the overall VR experience for users since they face little to no obstacles as they play the game.
            </p>
            <p>For one, open-world games such as The Legend of Zelda, Grand Theft Auto V, and Fornite have a mini-map.
                In fact, this small map undeniably helps the player to detect their location at any point. Nonetheless,
                not all open-world games use a mini-map and an example is the Assassin's Creed Odyssey which focuses on
                story and exploration.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-5">Narrowing Down the Space using a Smart Level Design</h3>
            <p>Usually, the VR team builds the VR environment based on designer-provided 3D models. Such models have
                real world practicality; yet, they are unsuitable for the VR space User-centric level designs should be
                the common goal of any model as users move differently when in Virtual Reality. By narrowing down the
                VR environment, users can find Schuco products in the VR space easily.</p>
            <p>The image below here compares the multiple-direction VR open space environment with the single path VR
                space
                design. It illustrates the benefits of the single path VR environment design which include increased
                clarity and reduced distraction for any player.</p>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/PjK00Yb/Image2.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="mb-4">
            <p>To achieve this technique, designers can block out the environment. The game, Outlast, employs this
                technique although it has an open environment and multiple paths seemingly. Nevertheless, this game
                cleverly blocks some paths using props to ensure that the user moves using the main path.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>VR Controllers</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The second issue which the VR team discovered was the inexperience of most users with the VR controllers.
            Generally, VCL developed VR applications using HTC Vive which was the choice platform. However, HTC Vive’s
            controller lacks the conventional game controller design which most VR players are familiar with. </p>
        <p>As an illustration, the most popular game controllers have four action buttons and a joystick. Nintendo
            Switch, Nintendo Wii, and Oculus Rift provide this design. On the contrary, HTC Vive made a bald move by
            creating an innovative design for its controllers where users see hands in Virtual Reality and this image
            differs from the actual controllers in their hands. This platform further increased user difficulty since
            users have to memorize the function and location of each button.</p>
        <p>A credible solution – Controllers should always have labels, such as is seen in Google Earth VR, so that
            users never have to worry that they will forget button functions. </p>
        <h2>Physical Comfort – a Key Feature of a Good VR Game</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Physical comfort is another essential feature of a good Virtual Reality experience. Mike Alger’s research
            proves that the human’s field of view is around 110° from left to right, 40° from middle to the bottom, and
            60° from the middle to the top. This finding, therefore, implies that it is safer to reduce the rate at
            which a user moves their arms and neck; otherwise, a 20-minute session of VR experience may be strenuous.</p>
        <p>When making a 2D prototype, traditional prototyping tools are good; however, they are inadequate for a 3D
            experience mockup. At VCL, the VR team have tried several different approached to develop a good UX design
            workflow for VR, including 2D storyboard and 3D user flow. The advantage of a 2D storyboard is efficiency.
            It is fast and easy to rearrange the storyboards and iterate
            ideas by doing new sketches. </p>
        <p>The VR team also tried to use Maya® to build a simple mockup for the user flow. The image below exemplifies
            a
            potentially new way to visualize a user flow map in 3D. It describes how the simple mockup helps designers
            to visually determine whether all the UI panels in the 3D space are conveniently positioned for the user’s
            eye, arms, and head. Likewise, this model allows developers to clearly and gradually gain a step-by-step
            understanding of what she needs to build.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In conclusion, this article has attempted to explain the significant differences between designing a VR
            application and designing apps for other devices and provide solutions to common problems. A great VR
            experience only occurs when the user has a great relationship with the 3D environment, a friendly UI in a
            convenient location, and clear navigation. When these conditions are satisfied, a VR application will be
            more rewarding. </p>
